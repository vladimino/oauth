OAuth2.0 - Episode 1
====================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/knpuniversity/oauth.png)](https://travis-ci.org/knpuniversity/oauth)

Sir or madam,
Inside this fine repository, you'll find a few things:

## 1) Project Code!

Depending on which branch you're on, you may be seeing
the code and different "steps" along the way:

* `master` - The beginning stage of the project
* `finish` - The ending stage of the project

If you want to code along with the tutorial, start with the
code on the `master` branch. If you want to see the finished
product, go to the `finish` branch.

This tutorial actually has a few pieces:

a) `client` - This is the TopCluck website we build
b) `cron`   - A small CRON-job script we build
c) `server` - The source code for the COOP server we use

Inside each directory are instructions on how to get things running.

## 2) The Written Script

On the `master` branch only, there is a `knpu` branch. This contains
the written script for the tutorial.

## Contributing! Woot!

We hope this (and all) tutorials can be living, breathing guides that
evolve over time. Did we screw something up? Do you have a note from
personal experience that would be helpful to others? We want that!

And as always, thanks so much for your support and letting us do what
we love!

<3 Your friends at KnpUniversity
